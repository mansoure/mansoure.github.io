Dr. Essam Mansour received his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2008 from Dublin Institute of Technology [(DIT)](http://www.dit.ie/), Ireland. 
He graduated from [Cairo University](http://www.fci.cu.edu.eg/), Egypt in 2000 with a First Class Honours B.Sc. in Information Systems, and in 2003 with an M.Sc. in Information Systems. 
He was a Research and Teaching Fellow in [International University in Germany Bruchsal](http://i-u.de/) from July 2008 to Oct 2009, and in King Abdullah University of Science and Technology [(KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en) from Oct 2009 to Jun 2013. 
Dr. Mansour joined Qatar Computing Research Institute [(QCRI)](http://qcri.com/) as a Senior Research Software Engineer in June, 2013. QCRI is a part of Hamad Bin Khalifa University [(HBKU)](http://www.hbku.edu.qa/). 

# QCRI
At QCRI, he is working on the [Crosscloud project](/projects/crosscloud) for re-decentralizing the web and leading the development of a collaborative data management system based on RDF graphs. The Crosscloud project is a collaboration with [Prof. Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) at MIT. Dr. Mansour is also leading a research project for advanced query processing over decentralized RDF graphs with [Prof. Panos Kalnis](http://web.kaust.edu.sa/faculty/PanosKalnis/) at KAUST. He worked in the [e-store](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2735514) project, an elastic in-memory OLTP system applied to [H-Store](http://hstore.cs.brown.edu/). This project was a collaboration with [Prof. Michael Stonebraker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stonebraker) at MIT.

# KAUST
At KAUST, Dr. Essam Mansour was a research fellow working with [Prof. Panos Kalnis](http://web.kaust.edu.sa/faculty/PanosKalnis/). Dr. Mansour led a project for developing a framework for a cloud-based string database system. The project aimed to bridge the gap between Big Data analytics and cloud computing.
Dr. Mansour has developed different parallel string algorithms, such as maximal pairs and motif extraction. His system utilizes multi-core systems, clusters and supercomputers. Compared to recent methods, his system can expect much faster execution while supporting 2-3 orders of magnitude more data than existing methods. Moreover, his system reports scalability up to 16,384 cores on a supercomputer. 

Dr. Mansour delivered a complete course in Cloud Computing at KAUST. Additionally, he offered different lectures on advanced data management for KAUST students.
