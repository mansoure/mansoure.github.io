## Collaborative Data Sharing over Decentralized Graphs

This project aims to develop an efficient system and software tools to make it easy for users to share datasets with each other. In life sciences and social applications, users need to maintain their data independently of the applications consuming this data. The resource description framework (RDF) is extensively used to represent datasets on the Web. It uses a simple data model in the form of triples <subject, predicate, object>. A key feature is the ability to link two different entities from two different RDF datasets which are maintained by two local independent authorities, which could be users, research labs, or hospitals. Large decentralized graphs can be easily created among a large number of RDF stores where each RDF store provides its own SPARQL endpoint. [Read more](/research/meccano/)



## An Elastic in-memory OLTP System


On-line transaction processing (OLTP) database management systems
(DBMSs) often serve time-varying workloads due to daily,
weekly or seasonal fluctuations in demand, or because of rapid
growth in demand due to a company’s business success. In addition,
many OLTP workloads are heavily skewed to “hot” tuples
or ranges of tuples. For example, the majority of NYSE volume
involves only 40 stocks. To deal with such fluctuations, an OLTP
DBMS needs to be elastic; that is, it must be able to expand and
contract resources in response to load fluctuations and dynamically
balance load as hot tuples vary over time. [Read more](/research/estore/)


## Large-scale Analytics on Strings


Stings are common datasets in a variety of applications such as bioinformatics,
time series analysis, clustering, text editing, log analysis, and data compression. 
There is an explosion in the production of string datasets. Analytics on strings are computationally demanding. Most of the existing solutions are not designed to utilize large computing infrastructures. Therefore, these solutions are limited to small datasets. [Read more](/research/starDB/)
