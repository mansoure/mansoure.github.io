# Welcome

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer-Science and Software Engineering at Concordia University in Montreal, and the head of the Concordia Data Systems (CoDS) lab. My research interests are in the broad areas of parallel/distributed systems, data management, and machine learning for developing systems for federated data science and big data analytics. 

## Current Research projects at CoDS:

- A Data Discovery Platform for Data Science
- A Natural Language Platform for Querying RDF Graphs
- A Federated Learning Platform for linked data and Knowledge Graphs
- Data Science Versioning Control with Explanation and Data Bias Detection Methods

## I am looking for PhD students with the following qualifications: 
- excellent skills in programming, 
- M.Sc. in computer science or a related field,
- experience in databases, RDF, NLP, GNN, ML, computer security, or distributed systems, and 
- excellent written and oral communication skills (English).

> **Note: I do not have openings for Master students.** 

## Other Recent Research Projects
