# Welcome

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer-Science and Software Engineering at Concordia University in Montreal, and the head of the [Cognitive Data Science (CoDS) lab](https://cods-gcs.github.io). My research program focuses on developing systems for **Linked Data Science** on federated and big datasets. My research interests are in the broad areas of parallel/distributed systems, data management, knowledge graphs, and graph neural networks.
