# Welcome

I am a Scientist at Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI), Hamad bin Khalifa University (HBKU). My research interests include database systems, large-scale data analytics, Web data management, parallel/distributed systems, and machine learning, with focus on:

- data cleaning,
- scalable discovery and analytics on large graphs,
- parallel and distributed data analytics and OLTP systems,
- data integration in life sciences and social applications, and
- pattern recognition and motif extraction in long sequences.


## Recent and Current Research Projects
