# Welcome

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Concordia University in Montreal and the head of the [Cognitive Data Science (CoDS) lab](https://cods-gcs.github.io). My research program focuses on developing systems for **Linked Data Science** on federated and big datasets. My research interests are in the broad areas of knowledge graphs, graph neural networks, large language models, parallel/distributed systems, and data management.
