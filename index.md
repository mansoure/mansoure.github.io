# Welcome

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer-Science and Software Engineering at Concordia University in Montreal, and the head of the Concordia Data Systems (CoDS) lab. My research interests are in the broad areas of parallel/distributed systems, data management, and machine learning for developing scalable systems for big data. My current research focuses on the following areas:

- Discovery and analytics on large datasets
- Parallel query processing on large graphs and strings 
- Distributed and federated RDF engines for linked data
- A unified infrastructure for cyber security applications


## Recent and Current Research Projects 

- [The Data Civilizer System](/research/dc/)
<!-- - [Collaborative Sharing and Data Integration over Decentralized Graphs](/research/lusail/) -->
- [Managing Linked Data at Scale: Querying, Integrating, and Sharing](/research/lusail/)
- [Elastic in-memory OLTP Systems](/research/estore/)
- [Large-scale Analytics on Strings](/research/starDB/)
