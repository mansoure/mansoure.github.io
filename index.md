I am a Senior Research Software Engineer at Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI), Hamad bin Khalifa University (HBKU). My research interest is in database systems, Web-scale information sharing, and parallel/distributed systems. I focus on developing novel systems that address challenges, which arise in life sciences and social applications, distributed transaction processing (NewSQL), and large-scale data analytics. 

## Recent and current research projects 

- Lotus: query processing over decentralized RDF graphs
- E-Store: an elastic in-memory OLTP system
- StarDB: a string database system for large-scale analytics
